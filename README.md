# iso-rts
An isometric Real Time Strategy game

Currently in early stage. Current name is temporary.

You can follow the development on [my blog](http://blog.davidecoppola.com/) or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidecoppola/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vivaladav) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYD1ElkmiIklQRemVGxarw).

## Current status
Active development, core gameplay implemented.
It's possible to play a single game against up to 3 AI opponents even if at the moment the AI is super basic (stupid) and the number of AI opponents is hardcoded.
